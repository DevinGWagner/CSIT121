			<p>When attempting to do this project I ran into multiple sections were I would get a little hung up with how to code the CSS. In the end I was able to come up with a way that would layout the page well on a normal desktop but how to adjust it for smaller mobile/tablet screens. I originally planned on making each game have their very own page but that became overwhelming quickly due to the sheer number of pages required to be created. I then shifted into the final product which became pages sorted by the game genres instead.</p>
			<p>I was able to come up with the layout of the games and info taking up thirds of the used area. This made it so I was able to display the necessary info and statistics I wanted to show off in a more organized pattern. The mobile addition is essentially the same sort of layout but vertically stacked information. This layout became a bit more predictable and easy flowing.</p>
